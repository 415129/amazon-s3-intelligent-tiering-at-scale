## Easily enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering on Amazon S3 buckets at scale

In this post, we explain how Developers and Cloud ops can leverage S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tiers and optimize storage costs. 

We focus on multiple uses cases, first one for directly  uploading objects to S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. The second use case focuses on transitioning existing objects from S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA to S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, using a S3 Lifecycle policy. 

We also highlight how to enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering Lifecycle policy and Opt-in asynchronous Archive Access tiers at scale. Here, we cover two more common uses cases, first one for existing S3 buckets and the second one for newly created S3 buckets. These use cases enable Developers and Cloud ops to manage the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class configurations on individual S3 buckets or at scale across multiple S3 buckets in an AWS Account.
